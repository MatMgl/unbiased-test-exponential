# Unbiased Test for the Exponential Distribution

This repository contains a final project for the course **Testing Statistical Hypotheses**.

## 📝 Project Task

Let \( X_1, ..., X_n \) be a simple random sample from an exponential distribution with expected value \( \lambda \).

Construct a test of level \( \alpha = 0.05 \), which is the **most powerful among all unbiased tests** for the null hypothesis:  
\[
H_0: \lambda = 4 \quad \text{vs} \quad H_1: \lambda \neq 4
\]

Then, plot the **empirical power function** for \( n = 20 \) as a function of \( \lambda \) over the interval \( [2, 6] \).
