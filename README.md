# Unbiased Test for the Exponential Distribution

This repository contains a final project for the course **Testing Statistical Hypotheses**.

## 📝 Project Task

Let X₁, ..., Xₙ be a simple random sample from an exponential distribution with expected value lambda.

Construct a test of size α = 0.05 that is the **most powerful among all unbiased tests** for the null hypothesis:  
**H₀: lambda = 4** versus **H₁: lambda ≠ 4**

Then, plot the **empirical power function** for n = 20 as a function of lambda over the interval [2, 6].
